## Course Overview

This Compiler Design course covers fundamental concepts and techniques related to the design and implementation of compilers, utilizing ANTLR4 for parsing and code generation.

## ANTLR4 Setup

To use ANTLR4 with Python, you need to set up the ANTLR4 tool and runtime. Follow these steps to set up ANTLR4:

1. Install ANTLR4:

   ```bash
   # On Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS)
   $ sudo apt-get install antlr4

   # On Windows, you can download the ANTLR4 JAR file from the official website: https://www.antlr.org/download.html
   ```

2. Install the ANTLR4 Python runtime:

   ```bash
   $ pip install antlr4-python3-runtime
   ```
   
3. [Optional] Install the ANTLR4 Visual Studio Code extension for syntax highlighting and code completion.

For more detailed instructions and documentation, refer to the [ANTLR4 official website](https://www.antlr.org/).

## Homework Assignments

- [**Homework 2:** Just Hello World with antlr4 :)](HW2/)
- Soon

Each homework folder contains the necessary instructions, starter code, and any additional resources required for the assignment.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```plaintext
.
├── HW2/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── Main.py
│   ├──  gen/
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

  - `HW2``, ...: Homework assignment folders.
  - `README.md`: Specific instructions and details for the respective homework.
  - `gen/`: Antlr compiled files.

## Getting Started

To get started with a specific homework assignment, navigate to the corresponding folder (e.g., `HW2`) and follow the instructions provided in the `README.md` file.
